# Building a Real-World AI Agent with OpenAI and Postgres

This project demonstrates how to build a **real-world AI Agent** from scratch by integrating **OpenAI** with a **PostgreSQL** database to manage a simple **To-Do application**.  

The AI agent understands natural language queries and interacts with the database through predefined tools (functions). Using **Drizzle ORM** for schema management and queries, the assistant can create, search, update, and delete to-do items.

## üöÄ Features
- **Natural Language Interface**: Talk to your AI agent like you would to a human assistant.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL database with schema managed using **Drizzle ORM**.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Create a new todo
  - View all todos
  - Search todos
  - Delete todos by ID
- **AI Planning System**: The agent uses a structured prompt to PLAN, take ACTION, OBSERVE, and OUTPUT results.
